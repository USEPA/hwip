Is each structure required to have an individual EPA Identification (ID) Number?","text":"<p>For the purposes of generator notification and obtaining EPA ID Numbers, and assuming the structures are \"on-site\" as defined in 40 CFR 260.10, one identification number is sufficient for all structures at the facility site. For example, if a single company operates three laboratories on a single piece of property, all three laboratories may share one EPA ID Number, and the waste from all three laboratories may be evaluated together. However, if the company operates three laboratories at three different locations that are not considered to be on contiguous property, each laboratory is viewed as a separate potential generator and is required to obtain an individual EPA ID Number.</p> <p>Refer to the document RCRA Subtitle C EPA Identification Number, Site Status, and Site Tracking Guidance for Managing Data in RCRAInfo PDF (dated March 21, 2005) for additional information on RCRA policy memoranda and other documents associated with the assignment of EPA ID Numbers.</p>"},{"location":"data/waste-report-faq/#24-does-a-large-quantity-generator-lqg-who-generates-a-hazardous-waste-in-december-of-a-non-reporting-year-but-ships-it-in-january-of-the-reporting-year-need-to-include-that-waste-in-their-biennial-report","title":"24.

Consequently, they are not considered large quantity generators (LQGs) or TSDFs and thus, are not subject to the federal biennial reporting requirements (40 CFR 262.41 for LQGs, and 40 CFR 264.75 and 40 CFR 265.75 for TSDFs).</p> <p>Authorized states may have hazardous waste programs that are more stringent and/or broader in scope than the federal program.
