**Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)**

The Code of Federal Regulations is the official, codified collection of general and permanent rules published by the executive departments and agencies of the U.S. federal government. It is divided into subject-based 50 titles, with Protection of Environment being Title 40. Hazardous waste regulations are primarily in Parts 260-273.

**EPA Identification (ID) Number**

May also be referred to as Site ID, Handler ID, or RCRA ID Number. The EPA ID Number is the unigue identification number assigned to each U.S. handler of hazardous waste, including hazardous waste generators, recyclers, transporters, and management facilities. The federal regulations include notification and ID number requirements for various types of hazardous waste-related sites.

**Hazardous Secondary Material (HSM)**

A secondary material (e.g., spent material, by-product, or sludge) that, when discarded, would be identified as hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Facilities managing hazardous secondary material under 40 CFR 261.2(a) or 40 CFR 261.4(a) must complete the Addendum to the Site Identification Form: Notification for Managing Hazardous Secondary Material.

**RCRA**

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) is a federal law that establishes the framework for managing hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste. The HWIP generally focuses on the hazardous waste side of RCRA.
