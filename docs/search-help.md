# Site Search Help
The Hazardous Waste Information Platform’s Site Searches query a database of hundreds of thousands of hazardous waste handler records to find those in which you’re interested. You can locate sites of interest by using the basic search on the home page or the Advanced Search form. Both options take you to the same interactive search results display.
## What is a Site?
The word “site” on this website refers to any type of regulated hazardous waste handler, including hazardous waste generators, transporters, and treatment, storage, and disposal facilities.
## Search Tips
-	You must specify at least one search term.
-	You need only specify the search terms that are of most interest to you. 
-	On the Advanced Search, expand or collapse the categories by clicking the corresponding arrow. 
-	On the Advanced Search, clicking the Reset bottom at the bottom of the page removes all of your selections.

You may select multiple codes to return facilities that have at least one unit with on of the codes.

**TSDF Status**

Search for Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities based on the Operating Status of the facilities' most recent hazardous waste management unit data. 

*Clean Closed*: The clean closed status indicates a unit that has completed clean closure. Closure is completed when all closure activities required by hazardous waste regulations have been completed and verified.

*Closed With Waste In Place*: The closed with waste in place status indicates a unit that has completed closure with waste left in the unit and contained. Closure is completed when all closure activities required by hazardous waste regulations have been completed and verified.

*Inactive/closing, but not yet RCRA Closed*: This status indicates a unit that has received its final amount of hazardous waste but has not completed all closure activities required by hazardous waste regulations.

*Operating*: An Operating Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facility is a facility that is subject to hazardous waste permit requirements and is treating, storing, or disposing of hazardous waste. This status includes every facility that has at least one hazardous waste management unit where the most recent unit data indicates it is actively managing hazardous waste.

*Post-Closure Care*: This is a grouping of three operating statuses. 
- Under Alternate Enforceable Document for Post-Closure Care: unit closed with waste in place or cannot attain clean closure and has an approved post-closure plan or similar enforceable document (such as a consent order) covering post-closure care obligations.
