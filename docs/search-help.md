# Site Search Help
The Hazardous Waste Information Platform’s Site Searches query a database of hundreds of thousands of hazardous waste handler records to find those in which you’re interested. You can locate sites of interest by using the basic search on the home page or the Advanced Search form. Both options take you to the same interactive search results display.
## What is a Site?
