# Site Search Help
The Hazardous Waste Information Platform’s Site Searches query a database of hundreds of thousands of hazardous waste handler records to find those in which you’re interested. You can locate sites of interest by using the basic search on the home page or the Advanced Search form. Both options take you to the same interactive search results display.
## What is a Site?
The word “site” on this website refers to any type of regulated hazardous waste handler, including hazardous waste generators, transporters, and treatment, storage, and disposal facilities.
## Search Tips
-	You must specify at least one search term.
-	You need only specify the search terms that are of most interest to you. 
-	On the Advanced Search, expand or collapse the categories by clicking the corresponding arrow. 
-	On the Advanced Search, clicking the Reset bottom at the bottom of the page removes all of your selections.
-	Searches that return a large number of facilities may load slowly. A loading indicator provides a visual indication that HWIP is retrieving results.
-	You can narrow your search by specifying additional site characteristics.

## Advanced Search Criteria
### Site
**Site ID**

The unique EPA Identification Number assigned by EPA or authorized state agency to each hazardous waste handler. Allows entry of a partial ID number with at least two characters. Entry of a partial ID will return sites with ID numbers that begin with the search term.

**Site Name**

Search for facilities or permits by name or partial name. Be sure to try all possible variations of a facility's name. For example, if an abbreviation does not work, try using whole words (for example, International Metals Company instead of INMETCO). The search is not case sensitive. Anything else about how this works?

**Include Previous Site Names?**

Edit this.
  
**NAICS Codes**

A 2- to 6-digit code indicating the industrial activity of the site as defined by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), which is maintained by the U.S. [Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/naics/). The first two digits represent the Industry sector, in which there exist 20 broad sectors. Each digit adds more specificity. How many digits must users include?
