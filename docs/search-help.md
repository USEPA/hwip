# Site Search Help
The Hazardous Waste Information Platform’s Site Searches query a database of hundreds of thousands of hazardous waste handler records to find those in which you’re interested. You can locate sites of interest by using the basic search on the home page or the Advanced Search form. Both options take you to the same interactive search results display.
## What is a Site?
The word “site” on this website refers to any type of regulated hazardous waste handler, including hazardous waste generators, transporters, and treatment, storage, and disposal facilities.
## Search Tips
-	You must specify at least one search term.
-	You need only specify the search terms that are of most interest to you. 
-	On the Advanced Search, expand or collapse the categories by clicking the corresponding arrow. 
-	On the Advanced Search, clicking the Reset bottom at the bottom of the page removes all of your selections.
-	Searches that return a large number of facilities may load slowly. A loading indicator provides a visual indication that HWIP is retrieving results.
