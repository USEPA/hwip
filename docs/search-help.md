# Site Search Help
The Hazardous Waste Information Platform’s Site Searches query a database of hundreds of thousands of hazardous waste handler records to find those in which you’re interested. You can locate sites of interest by using the basic search on the home page or the Advanced Search form. Both options take you to the same interactive search results display.
## What is a Site?
The word “site” on this website refers to any type of regulated hazardous waste handler, including hazardous waste generators, transporters, and treatment, storage, and disposal facilities.
## Search Tips
-	You must specify at least one search term.
-	You need only specify the search terms that are of most interest to you.

### Waste Treatment, Storage or Disposal

Note: searching by Management Process Codes, TSDF Status, and Commercial Status returns sites that have hazardous waste management units that meet the criteria selected for each of the search options.

**Management Process Codes**

A process code represents a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal process. The processes that will be used to treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste at a facility are included in a facility's permit. Select a code to search for facilities that have at least one hazardous waste management unit where the most recent unit data includes the code. You may select multiple codes to return facilities that have at least one unit with one of the codes.

**TSDF Status**

Search for Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities based on the Operating Status of the facilities' most recent hazardous waste management unit data. 

*Clean Closed*: The clean closed status indicates a unit that has completed clean closure. Closure is completed when all closure activities required by hazardous waste regulations have been completed and verified.

*Closed With Waste In Place*: The closed with waste in place status indicates a unit that has completed closure with waste left in the unit and contained. Closure is completed when all closure activities required by hazardous waste regulations have been completed and verified.

*Inactive/closing, but not yet RCRA Closed*: This status indicates a unit that has received its final amount of hazardous waste but has not completed all closure activities required by hazardous waste regulations.

*Operating*: An Operating Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facility is a facility that is subject to hazardous waste permit requirements and is treating, storing, or disposing of hazardous waste. This status includes every facility that has at least one hazardous waste management unit where the most recent unit data indicates it is actively managing hazardous waste.

*Post-Closure Care*: This is a grouping of three operating statuses. 
- Under Alternate Enforceable Document for Post-Closure Care: unit closed with waste in place or cannot attain clean closure and has an approved post-closure plan or similar enforceable document (such as a consent order) covering post-closure care obligations.
- Referred to Corrective Action for Closure/Post-Closure: unit for which closure/post-closure requirements have been replaced by site-specific requirements developed for corrective action (hazardous waste cleanup) under regulatory authority.
- Completed Post-Closure Care: unit for which the post-closure care period has been completed and not verified.

Note: for information about the status of units at a TSDF, see the Permitting Details section of the Site Details Report. 

**Commercial Status**

Search for Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities based on the Commercial Status of the facilities' most recent hazardous waste management unit data. 

*Commercial*: Facility accepts waste from a variety of off-site generators, or facility accepts waste from limited off-site generators by special agreement.

*Non-Commercial*: Facility does not accept waste from off-site generators, or facility only accepts waste from related off-site generators.

Note: for the specific commercial status of a TSDF, see the Permitting Details section of the Site Details Report.

**Federal Waste Codes**

Search for facilities that manage specific federal waste types according to hazardous waste manifests or the latest Biennial Hazardous Waste Report. You may select multiple codes to return facilities that manage at least one of the waste types selected.

**State Waste Codes**

You must first select a State under Location to enable this search option. Note that not all states provide state-specific waste codes. Search for facilities that manage specific state waste types according to hazardous waste manifests or the latest Biennial Hazardous Waste Report. You may select multiple codes to return facilities that manage at least one of the waste types selected. 

### Waste Generation

**Federal Generator Category**

Search for sites based on their Federal Generator Category. A generator produces a hazardous waste as listed or characterized in part 261 of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Federal generator categories:
- Large Quantity Generators (LQGS) generate 1,000 kilograms per month or more of hazardous waste or more than one kilogram per month of acutely hazardous waste.
- Small Quantity Generators (SQGs) generate more than 100 kilograms, but less than 1,000 kilograms of hazardous waste per month.
- Very Small Quantity Generators (VSQGs) generate 100 kilograms or less per month of hazardous waste or one kilogram or less per month of acutely hazardous waste.

**State Generator Category**

You must first select a State under Location to enable this search option. Note that not all states have state-specific generator categories. Search for sites based on their State Generator Category.
