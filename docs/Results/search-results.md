# Site Search Results Help

Running a site search from the home page or the Advanced Search form brings you to the Search Results page. This page displays the sites that met your specific search criteria in a list and map. The view can be customized to show a data table and/or hide the map. 

## Features

### Search Criteria

**From home page search**

 The "Search by" bar above the results displays 
 - Whether you searched by Site Name or ID, entered a Location, or used your location ("Coordinates").
 - Your search term(s).

You may modify your site search by changing either or both of the above and click Search.

Note that the home page Location search returns sites that are within 10 miles of the center of location provided (whether city, state, or zip code). For a more specific, comprehensive search by location, use the Advanced Search.

**From Advanced Search**

Your search criteria is displayed in a bar above the results. Click "Search Criteria" to view the full list of criteria you entered on the form.

### Customize the View

On the top right of the map, click "Hide Map" to remove the map from view. To the right of the search criteria bar, click "Show Map" to display the map. On the map, click "Expand" for a full screen view of the map. Click "Collapse" to return to the default view.

On the bottom right of the map, toggle between a Street or Satellite base map view.

To the right of the search criteria bar, click "Table View" to see your search results in a table instead of a list of cards. From the "Table View", click "Card View" to return to a list of cards.

### Interact with the Data Display

**Card View**

Results are presented in alphabetical order by Site Name. You may change the Sort By option to Site ID.

Click on the image of the map pin on the right side of a card to zoom to that site on the map. Cards missing the pin are not displayed on the map, because the system does not have valid coordinates for the site.

Click on the Details button on the bottom right of the card to access the Site Details Report. 

**Table View**

Click on a column heading to sort results based on that column. 

Click on the value in the Lat/Long column to zoom to that site on the map.

Click on the value in the Site Name column to access the Site Details Report. 

### Interact with the Map

You may zoom and pan the map to explore the mapped sites. This does not affect the results set.

A circle around a number indicates multiple sites in the area. Click the circle to zoom in to and display single facilities.

Click on map pins to view the site's name and address. This action also highlight the site in the cards list or table.

### Download Results

When in the Table View, you may download your search results into a comma-separated values (CSV) file. CSV files can opened in spreadsheet software, such as Excel, for analysis.
- Click Full Dataset to download the facilities in your list along with additional data about each facility. The Full Dataset option is available for a results set of 10,000 sites or less.
- Click Quick CSV to download the facilities in your list with only the data you see on the screen.

### Adjust Search Criteria

**From home page search**

 To modify your search criteria, change either or both options in the "Search by" bar above the results and click Search.
 - Search by Site Name or ID, Location, or Coordinates (latitude and longitude in decimal degrees)
 - Your search term(s).

**From Advanced Search**

 To modify your search criteria, click the "Advanced Search" breadcrumb at the top of the page (between "Home" and "Search Results). Clicking your browser's back button also works during the same session. On the Advanced Search, change and/or add search criteria and click Search.
