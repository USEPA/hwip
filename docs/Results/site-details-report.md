### Site Identification

**Location & Mailing Addresses**

This table lists the site's location address and its mailing address, according to the latest source record.

**Owner / Operator / Contact Information**

This table lists each of the site's owners, operators, and contacts, according to the latest source record.
  
**Industry Categories (NAICS)**

This table displays all NAICS codes listed for the site, according to the latest source record. These are 2- to 6-digit codes indicating the industrial activity of the site as defined by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), which is maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau. The first two digits represent the industry sector, and each digit adds more specificity.

**Federal Activities**

Lists each type of federal waste activity reported on the latest source record. With the exception of Hazardous Waste Cleanup Site, activities correspond to questions on the EPA Form 8700-12 (Site Identification Form). Data is based on the site's most recent notification, which may no longer be accurate. Only the activities that apply to the facility are listed and may include:

- Academic Laboratory Activities: site managing laboratory hazardous waste under 40 CFR 262 Subpart K as an eligible academic laboratory.
- Exempt Boiler and/or Industrial Furnace: site indicated it qualifies for the smelting, melting, and refining furnace exemption in 40 CFR 266.
- Hazardous Secondary Materials: site managing hazardous secondary material (HSM) under 40 CFR 261.
- Hazardous Waste Cleanup Site: site is on U.S. EPA's list of hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities in the cleanup pipeline reflecting program priorities, known as the RCRA Corrective Action Progress Track.
- Importer of Hazardous Waste: site imports hazardous waste into the U.S. from a foreign country. Importers must obtain an EPA identification number prior to engaging in import activities.
- Importer/Exporter of Spent Lead Acid Batteries: site imports or exports spent lead-acid batteries.
- Pharmaceutical Activities - Healthcare Facility: site managing hazardous waste pharmaceuticals under 40 CFR 266 Subpart P as a healthcare facility.
- Pharmaceutical Activities - Reverse Distributor: site managing hazardous waste pharmaceuticals under 40 CFR 266 Subpart P as a reverse distributor, which is any person who receives and accumulates prescription pharmaceuticals that are potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals for the purpose of facilitating or verifying manufacturer credit.
- Recognized Trader: person domiciled in the U.S., by site of business, who acts to arrange and facilitate transboundary movements of wastes destined for recovery or disposal operations, either by purchasing from and subsequently selling to U.S. and foreign facilities, or by acting under arrangements with a U.S. waste facility to arrange for the export or import of the wastes.

- Transporter: site engaged in the off-site transportation of hazardous waste by air, rail, highway, or water.
- Underground Injection Control: site places hazardous waste or its residuals into an underground injection well (Class I well). 40 CFR 148 identifies wastes that are restricted from disposal into Class I wells and defines specific circumstances under which those wastes may be injected. The wells are regulated under Safe Drinking Water Act Underground Injection Control regulations.
- Universal Waste - Destination Facility: site treats, disposes of, or recycles federal universal waste - batteries, pesticides, mercury containing equipment, lamps, and/or aerosol cans - on-site.

**State Activities**

This table displays any state waste activities reported on the latest source record. Note that not all states have state-specific activity types.

### Recent Episodic Events

The Recent Episodic Events table displays any non-routine waste generation events reported in the last year. An episodic event, as defined in part 262 of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, is an activity that does not normally occur during a generator’s operations and that causes that generator to exceed the threshold for its normal generator category for that month. Very small quantity generators and small quantity generators can experience episodic events, which can be planned or unplanned.

### Hazardous Waste Cleanups

The Hazardous Waste Cleanups table displays, for hazardous waste cleanup sites:

- whether events related to corrective action remedy selection and remedy construction have been reported. 
- whether human exposure and groundwater events have been reported, in the Environmental Indicators column. 
- whether the ready for anticipated use event has been reported.
- whether performance standards were attained and cleanup process terminated. 

### Permitting

The Permitting Details table shows the latest unit details of the hazardous waste management units that are or were at the site. Note that the latest status update may have taken place years ago.

### Manifests

**Manifest Shipments**

This table summarizes the waste shipped from the site by year, based on the data on hazardous waste manifests. 

**Manifest Receipts**
