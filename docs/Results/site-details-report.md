With the exception of Hazardous Waste Cleanup Site, activities correspond to questions on the EPA Form 8700-12 (Site Identification Form). Data is based on the site's most recent notification, which may no longer be accurate. Only the activities that apply to the facility are listed and may include:

- Academic Laboratory Activities: site managing laboratory hazardous waste under 40 CFR 262 Subpart K as an eligible academic laboratory.
- Exempt Boiler and/or Industrial Furnace: site indicated it qualifies for the smelting, melting, and refining furnace exemption in 40 CFR 266.
- Hazardous Secondary Materials: site managing hazardous secondary material (HSM) under 40 CFR 261.
- Hazardous Waste Cleanup Site: site is on U.S. EPA's list of hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities in the cleanup pipeline reflecting program priorities, known as the RCRA Corrective Action Progress Track.
- Importer of Hazardous Waste: site imports hazardous waste into the U.S. from a foreign country. Importers must obtain an EPA identification number prior to engaging in import activities.

**State Activities**

This table displays any state waste activities reported on the latest source record. Note that not all states have state-specific activity types.

### Recent Episodic Events

This table displays any non-routine waste generation events reported in the last year. An episodic event, as defined in part 262 of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, is an activity that does not normally occur during a generator’s operations and that causes that generator to exceed the threshold for its normal generator category for that month. Very small quantity generators and small quantity generators can experience episodic events, which can be planned or unplanned.
